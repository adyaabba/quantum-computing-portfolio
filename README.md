# Quantum Computing Portfolio

Welcome to my Quantum Computing Portfolio. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, tutorials, and research related to quantum computing.

## Projects

### 1. Hello World with Qiskit
- **Description**: My first tutorial exploring the basics of Qiskit. This notebook introduces quantum circuits, gates, and running a basic quantum program.
- Files: `episode-3-hello-world.ipynb`

### 2. Hello World with Qiskit
- **Description**: Simulates a quantum system modeling single and multi-qubit gates using Qiskit. Run as a standalone python file ('python 'qiskit Quantum Glasses.py' into terminal and cd into your folder where this .py is located).
- Files: `qiskit Quantum Glasses.py`
